  <p>I love music. There are many different genres of music.</p>

</ul>

    <p>I enjoy all genres of music, but my favorites are Blues, Country, Gospel, Jazz, R&B/Soul, and Reggae.
      <br> My favorite female artist is Mary J. Blige, and my favorite male artist is R. Kelly, both of whom make music
      <br> in the R&B/Soul music genre. My favorite group is New Edition, they also make music in R&B music genre as well
      <br> as pop music. I have enjoyed these three musical artists since the beginnimg of their careers. New Edition has
      <br> been in the music business the longest since 1978, but gained national fame in 1983 with the release of their song "Candy Girl".
      <br> Mary J. Blige entered the musical spotlight in 1992. with the release of her first album, "What'a the 411?", and R. Kelly
      <br> as the lead singer of Public Announcement in 1992, and then as a solos artist in 1993 with his album entitled "12 Play".
      <br> These artists still continue to produce music that pleases countless fans today.</p>
